## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Task  

Create 1-2 multipanel figure(s) that demonstrate your mastery of data handling and visualization in R.

Your figures should showcase:

1.  Data wrangling using tidyr and dplyr
2.  Advanced ggplot2 visualization
3.  Spatial data handling and mapping (create a map in R or QGIS)
4.   Integration of various plot types into cohesive multipanel figure(s)

# Data source and context 

This data come was downloaded from Jonthegreek github account <https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/8901222a0d0fcac636122e42d7fa0293148cec01/data/2020/2020-05-12> data/2020/2020-05-12 . However he is not the main source and in his quote.

"The data comes from [The Smithsonian Institution](https://volcano.si.edu/). He also states [Axios](https://www.axios.com/chart-every-volcano-that-erupted-since-krakatoa-467da621-41ba-4efc-99c6-34ff3cb27709.html) put together a lovely plot of volcano eruptions since Krakatoa (after 1883) by elevation and type.
